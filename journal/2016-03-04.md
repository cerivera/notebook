I was unexpectedly promoted to Lead Software Engineer yesterday.

The previous night, I was browsing our internal Roster page to copy-paste my official title into LinkedIn--I knew it had to have changed because I was recently bumped to the manager-level bonus pool.  My title, along with many others, had changed.

Yesterday, our Chief Digital Officer emailed everyone with a list of promotions and my name was on that list.  The promotions must have happened recently.

To be honest, I felt uncomfortable.  There are a lot of people missing on that list that are better programmers than I am, or at least deserve a title as high as mine.

Last winter, my manager told me there was a reputation about me floating around the company--a good one.  I'm baffled at how that happened.  Most of my time at Under Armour has been about asking questions, and I've always struggled to give feedback.

I don't know what to do differently with my new title.  Honestly, I don't think I need to change a thing.  I need to continue strengthening my relationships with people, and continue asking questions and asking for feedback because it's obviously working.
