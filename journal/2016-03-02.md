I was always scared of a promotion because I didn't think I would succeed at the next level.  Today, I told myself "Carlos, you're really good when you have someone above you that knows what they're doing."

Umm, Earth to Carlos, in almost any job you will have someone above you to help you find answers.  That's how an organization works. 

No one is expecting me to have all the answers.  Do you think Brad and Ben excepected Amy to know everything about how authentication works in Discover?  Did they expect me to know everything about getting started our project started with celery and Elasticsearch?   My boss's job is to direct me when I need help, or to correct me when I'm wrong.  There's nothing wrong with this.  Employees only become a problem when they repeatedly make the same mistakes.

Good news is that I'm pretty good at applying everything that I've been taught.  This is evident in my code reviews because they're being merged with minimal iterations.
