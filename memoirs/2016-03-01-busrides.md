## McDonalds Birthday Party

I am obsessed with being punctual.  My wife and I arrive at parties before the hosts are finished showering; it's not because we arrive early, but because we arrive on time--and no one expects that.

A childhood memory comes to mind when I ask myself why I'm wired this way.

In elementary school, I remember one of my close friends having her birthday party at a local McDonalds; it was about two miles from my house and my uncle was responsible for getting me there on the bus.  When we arrived, I saw all of the abandoned games throughout the restaurant; the kids were done playing and it was now time for the Happy Meals.  My close friend Miguel teased me about only being interested in the party for the food.  It was one of the saddest meals I've ever had.

I can't remember why we were so late.  My uncle was probably in no rush to make it to a kid's birthday party, or the bus was unreliable as always; however, now that I'm an adult, I've made it a priority to be punctual.  It has taken my wife some time to adjust, but she's starting to realize that it's a valuable attribute to have.
