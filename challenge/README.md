## Day 1

Take us through a written walk down your street and to your favorite place through the eyes of somebody else.

## Day 2

Think of three people in your life. Give your character the hair and laugh of person 1, the face and bedroom of person 2, and the wardrobe and mannerisms of person 3. This is your new protagonist. Feel free to give him or her any other characteristics you'd like. Give us an idea of who your character is by describing only the first 60 seconds of the character's day.

## Day 3

Now send your character to his or her grumpy grandmother's house for a visit. Write the scene of your character's arrival.

## Day 4

Imagine that your protagonist has just turned into a statue. Describe his or her thoughts.

## Day 5

The last liquid you drank has turned your protagonist into a superhero. What do your character's new powers allow him or her to do?

## Day 6

Think of your favorite food. Try to make it sound as disgusting as possible.

## Day 7

Spoil the ending of your favorite movie without any context.

## Day 8

Take a nondescript sentence such as, "How are you?" Write the same line from at least five different points of view.

Haiku

## Day 9

Turn a Tweet into a haiku.

## Day 10

Try to convince your reader that the mythological creature of your choosing exists.

## Day 11

You are now a dragon. Describe your hoard.

## Day 12

Take the first line of your favorite novel. Remove and replace the nouns and verbs, and write a story that begins with your new line. Delete the first line.

## Day 13

Think of the worst pain you've ever felt. Now give your protagonist a papercut and over-exaggerate the pain using your own descriptions.

## Day 14

Your character meets somebody new on the bus. His or her opinion about the person is changed by the end of the bus trip. How did this change occur?

## Day 15

Characterize the second-last app on your phone or the last website you've visited (before this one). Send this new character to the supermarket.

## Day 16

The last thing you touched (other than the keyboard, mouse, screen, etc.) is trying to kill your protagonist. Explain why.

## Day 17

A magic trick involving cards has gone horribly wrong. What are the consequences?

## Day 18

Free write about your first protagonist (from Day 1) meeting the new character from Day 15.

## Day 19

Cross an item off your bucket list by doing it in your writing.

## Day 20

Ask somebody you know how his or her day was. Make any kind of poem out of their answer.

## Day 21

Your character's skeleton is trying to escape his or her body. Describe what happens.

## Day 22

Find a clich√© you absolutely hate. Rewrite it while keeping the intended meaning intact.

## Day 23

Make an existing protagonist into an antagonist by changing one small thing about him or her. Write a pitch that sells this antagonist's story.
