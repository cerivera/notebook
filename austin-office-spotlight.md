# UACF â€“ Austin Office Spotlight

##### What do you think are a few essential elements of a great work environment?

Managers that enforce a work-life balance, diverse teammates to keep conversations interesting, and unlimited Topo Chico's to stay cool in Texas.  Teammates that share my enthusiasm in our products also helps!


##### What's your favorite part about coming into the UA Connected Fitness Headquarters office in Austin, TX? (e.g., the view, snacks, common spaces, games)

The in-house fitness classes were my favorite when I just started; sharing jabs and front kicks in MMA is the quickest way to connect with new teammates!  It's also amazing to see SportsCenter on as I'm entering the lobby, in the restroom while I'm washing my hands, and in the break room as I'm hunting for snacks.  That was a sure-fire hiring tactic for me!

##### I've noticed you post up in the dining area to watch soccer matches and other live games on the TVs. Have there been any amazing moments you were able to catch that you might have missed if you worked in a traditional workplace?

Christiano Ronaldo's goal against Roma earlier this year was amazing, but nothing tops Eric Wood streaming the Tour de France during his 8AM spin class!  It was so real that I expected a participation award at the end.
